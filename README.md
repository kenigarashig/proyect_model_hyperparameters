# proyect_model_hyperparameters

main.ipynb
change days to int values 
Calculated the pearson and spearman relationship to know the monotonic relationship and if it has linear relationship with the other variables to determine what type of regression i should use.
I cleaned the data based on the correlation matrix, to aboid redundancy in the model.

model.ipynb
imported the cleaned data and made a lazy regressor to know which model fits better to make predictions of the data.
then i changed the hyperparameters of 3 choosed model to increase the r2
